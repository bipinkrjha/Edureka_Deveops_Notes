gitHub --> Online (Centralized) Code Repository
git --> version control system (VCS)

why VCS?
1. To track changes --> who committed the changes, and when the commit was done, what was the change?
2. To retrieve files from accidental deletes

2 types of VCS:
Centralised VCS --> svn
Distributed VCS --> git

2 drawbacks of centralized VCS
1. internet connection all the time
2. multiple developers cann't work on same file simultaneously
